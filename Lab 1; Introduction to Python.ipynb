    "Functions are an essential part of a programming language. You already used many functions like `plot`, and `linspace`. But you can also define your own functions. To define a new function, use the `def` command. After def follows the name of the function and then between parentheses the arguments of the function and finally a colon. After the colon you indent until you are done with the function. The last line of the function should be `return` followed by what you want to return. For example, consider the following function of x:\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(x)=cos(x) \\qquad x<0$\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(x)=exp(−x) \\qquad x≥0$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's implement $f(x)$ in a function called `func`. There is one input argument: **x**."
